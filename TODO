Fully automated, complete testing, for every option
	This is annoying because it would involve changing the output scaling and
	testing many things with different setups. Maybe we can script it somehow?

Rewrite using rustix + signal_hook instead of nix.

Do not use a pipe as a way of waking up the main thread in the daemon. A simple
fd should do.

	- copy over their implementation of RawPool (see if we can improve it for
	our purposes)
	- manually implemented all the wayland handling code in daemon/src/main.rs
	in a wayland.rs module
This will make it easier to include newer protocols later own. For example,
fractional scaling, presentation time, and HDR. It will also prevent huge rewrites
due to changes in sctk's api (like has happened before).
