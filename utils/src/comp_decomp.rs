//! # Compression Strategy
//!
//! For every pixel, we drop the alpha part; I don't think anyone will use transparency for a
//! background (nor if it even makes sense)
//!
//! For what's left, we store only the difference from the last frame to this one. We do that as
//! follows:
//! * First, we count how many pixels didn't change. We store that value as a u8.
//!   Everytime the u8 hits the max (i.e. 255, or 0xFF), we push in onto the vector
//!   and restart the counting.
//! * Once we find a pixel that has changed, we count, starting from that one, how many changed,
//!   the same way we counted above (i.e. store as u8, everytime it hits the max push and restart
//!   the counting)
//! * Then, we store all the new bytes.
//! * Start from the top until we are done with the image
//!
