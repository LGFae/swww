### Unreleased

Improvements:
  * Images (and animations) are now cached at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` #65
  * We now have man-pages! They must be installed manually in your system by
    moving the files in `doc/generated` to the appropriate location. Typically,
	you can figure out where that is by running `manpath`. The script
	`doc/gen.sh` will create the above directory and all the relevant manpages.
	Note that the script depends on `scdoc` being installed in the system.
	Have a look at it for more details.
  * We now also have automated spell checking. This let us fix a number in typos
    in our documentation, both internal and user-oriented.

Internal:
  * Integration tests are not run by default. You must now use
  `cargo test -- --ignored` to run them. This will make it possible for some
  people (like the ones trying to package `swww` at Nix) to run some of the
  tests in a sandboxed environment where they don't have access to the wayland
  server. If anyone is interested in running *all* tests, they can do that with
  `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### 0.7.1

Improvements:
  * you can now use absolute screen coordinates with `--transition-pos`
  (@flick0)

Fixes:
  * `swww query` not returning the image being displayed
  * document `--no_resize` and `--fill_color` options for `swww img`
  * reading img from stdin (now with a proper integration test to make sure
  it doesn't happen again) (#42)

Internal:
  * fixed `tests/integration_tests.rs` calling the wrong `swww-daemon` binary

### 0.7.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

  * **ATTENTION, PACKAGE MAINTAINERS** - `swww` is now composed of two separate
  binaries: `swww` and `swww-daemon`. **Both** must be installed on the user's
  system in order for `swww` to work correctly. Doing this allowed for major
  improvements in terms of overall memory usage, among other things (#52).

Improvements:
 
 * separate client and daemon (see above).
 * we don't try to animate `gif` files that have only one frame
 * we can read images from stdin (not this does not work for animated gifs; we
 simply display the image's first frame) (#42)
 * `--no-resize` option (pads the outer part of the image with `fill-color`)
 (#37)
 * new transition: `wave`, by @flick0
 * reading image format properly (instead of using file extension) (#74)

Fixes:
  * fixed panic with on gif that had identical frames (#68)
  * fixed panic with fractional-scaling (#73) (by @thedmm)

Non-breaking Changes:
 * @flick0 changed the default `transition-step`


Internal:
 * Many improvements to the README.md (@aouerfelli and @flick0)


### 0.6.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

  * `transition-speed` no longer exists. Now, speed is controlled through a
  bezier curve (`transition-bezier`), and duration (`transition-duration`)
  flags (note this also applies to the env var, SWWW_TRANSITION_SPEED). A
  warning was added when we detect the presence of the SWWW_TRANSITION_SPEED
  environment variable. This warning will go away in the next release, it is
  only there as a means of making sure everyone knows the variable has been
  superseded, and having it in your configs no longer does anything.

Improvements:

  * New grow transition. Grow and outer transition now accept a --transition-pos
  command line argument. By @flick0.
  * Transitions `grow` and `outer` now both work with bezier curves (see
  breaking changes, above). This allows for finer control in animation speed
  than before. Also by @flick0.
  * Very slightly faster decompression routine

### 0.5.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

  * `swww query` now formats its output as `<output>: ...`, instead of
  `<output> = ...`. This will break your scripts if you relied on the output's
  format.

Improvements:

  * Fixed `swww` getting stuck on a futex when a new monitor was connected (#26)
  * New `wipe` transition by @flick0
  * Several small code improvements by @WhyNotHugo
  * Typo fix (@thebenperson)

### 0.4.3

  * Check to see if daemon is REALLY running when we see that socket already
  exists (#11)
  * Fix dpi scaling (#22)

### 0.4.2

  * Fixed #13.
  * Improved error message when daemon isn't running (#18)

### 0.4.1

  * Fixed regression where the image was stretched on resize (#16)

### 0.4.0

  * implemented the new transition effects

  * refactored socket code

  * refactored event loop initialization code, handling errors properly now

  * BREAKING CHANGE: we are using fast_image_resize to resize our images now.
  This makes resizing much faster (enough to smoothly play animations before
  caching is done), but it makes it so that the `Gaussian` and `Triangle`
  filters no longer exist. Furthermore, the filters `Bilinear` and `Mitchell`
  were added.

  * deleted previously deprecated `init -i` and `init -c` options

### 0.3.0

* Limited image formats to: `gif`, `jpeg`, `jpeg_rayon`, `png`, `pnm`, `tga`,
  `tiff`, `webp`, `bmp`, `farbfeld`
* Bumped rust edition to 2021
* Our custom compression is now even faster
* I did a rewrite of the way the code that handled animations was structured.
  This made caching a LOT faster, but it incurs in more memory usage, since
  we spawn an extra thread to make a pipeline. That said, since this also 
  greatly simplified the code itself, I considered it an overall positive
  change.
* Fixed a bug where the animation wouldn't stop until it had processed all the
  frames, even when it was told to.
* Setting a custom names and stack sizes to our threads. The custom name will
  help in debugging in the future, and the custom stack sizes lets us push the
  memory usage even lower.
* Did all the preparatory work for us to start writing new transition effects.
  Ideally they should come in the next version, which should hopefully also be
  our first release (since then I will consider swww to be pretty much feature
  complete).

### 0.2.0

Using unsafe to speed up decompression.
Also, `swww init -i` and `swww init -c` may now be considered deprecated.
It was originally created to bypass `swww init && swww img <path/to/img>` not
working. Now, however, it seems to be working properly. In hindsight, it was
probably already working for a while, but I failed to test it properly and
thought it was still a problem.

The `swww init -i` and `swww init -c` options shall remain for now, for 
compatibility and just in case a regression happens. Once I am confident
enough, they will be eliminated (that will let me erase around 50 lines of
code, I think).

### 0.1.0

Initial release.
