# DESCRIPTION
*swww* is a wallpaper manager that lets you change what your monitors display as
a background by controlling the *swww-daemon* at runtime.

It supports animated gifs and putting different stuff in different monitors. I
also did my best to make it as resource efficient as possible.

To start, begin by running *swww init*. That will set up the *swww-daemon*.
Then, you can send images to be displayed with *swww img*. To kill the daemon,
use *swww kill*.

*Note that swww only works in a compositor that implements the layer-shell
protocol*. Typically, _wlr-roots_ based compositors.

# FILES
*swww* will create the following files in your system:
	- A socket in _$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/swww.socket_ or _/tmp/swww/swww.socket_, if
	  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR does not exist.
	- Cache files in _$XDG_CACHE_HOME/swww_ or _$HOME/.cache/swww_ if
	  $XDG_CACHE_HOME does not exist. These are used to set the wallpaper to the
	  previous image when a monitor is (re)connected or turned on.
