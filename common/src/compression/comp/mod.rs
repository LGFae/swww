//! # Compression Strategy
//!
//! We only compress RBG images, 8 bytes per channel; I don't think anyone will use
//! transparency for a background (nor if it even makes sense)
//!
//! For what's left, we store only the difference from the last frame to this one.
//! We do that as follows:
//! * First, we count how many pixels didn't change. We store that value as a u8. Every time the u8
//!   hits the max (i.e. 255, or 0xFF), we push in onto the vector and restart the counting.
//! * Once we find a pixel that has changed, we count, starting from that one, how many changed, the
//!   same way we counted above (i.e. store as u8, every time it hits the max push and restart the
//!   counting)
//! * Then, we store all the new bytes.
//! * Start from the top until we are done with the image
//!
//! The default implementation lies in this file. Architecture-specific implementations
//! that make use of specialized instructions lie in other submodules.
